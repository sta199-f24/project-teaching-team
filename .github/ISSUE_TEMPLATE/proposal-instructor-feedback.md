Dear [TEAM_NAME]: Below is the score breakdown for your proposal. Details of things that should be updated / revised are provided in separate issues. As you address them, you should close the individual issues. 

You can do this in one of two ways: on GitHub by clicking on Close issue or via a commit that directly addresses the issue. Weâ€™ll practice the second one. If you preface your commits with "Fixes", "Fixed", "Fix", "Closes", "Closed", or "Close", the issue will be closed when you push the changes to your repo. For example, suppose you want to close issue #2 which suggested that you add a new line to the README, your commit message can say something like `Add a new line to the README, closes #2`.

Once you've closed all the other issues, close this one as well, so that going into the presentation you have no pending issues.

Each component is graded as follows:

- Meets expectations (full credit): All required elements are completed and are accurate. The narrative is written clearly, all tables and visualizations are nicely formatted, and the work would be presentable in a professional setting.
- Close to expectations (half credit): There are some elements missing and/or inaccurate. There are some issues with formatting.
- Does not meet expectations (no credit): Major elements missing. Work is not neatly formatted and would not be presentable in a professional setting.
