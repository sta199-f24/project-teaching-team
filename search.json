If you’ve chosen to do inference, make sure to include a justification for why that inferential approach is appropriate. If you’ve chosen to do modeling, describe the model(s) you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process."
